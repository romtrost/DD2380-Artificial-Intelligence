# Search

A minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening has been implemented to enable player 0 (green boat) to beat player 1 (red boat) in various game settings.

# HMM

Hidden Markov Models have been implemented that can recognise which fish belongs to which species.

# RL

A reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-Learning) has been implemented to make the player (diver) swim to the king fish while avoiding the jellyfish.
